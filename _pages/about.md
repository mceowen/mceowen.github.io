I am currently a researcher and PhD candidate studying convex optimization based trajectory planning for aerospace vehicles in the Aeronautics and Astronautics department at the University of Washington. My research is focused on sequential convex programming, specifically the successive convexification algorithm, applied to aerial quadrotor drones and hypersonic reentry vehicles. I served as the manager for the physical lab space at the Autonomous Controls Lab for many years, before transitioning my focus to full-time reentry trajectory optimization research. During my academic studies I've also developed broad experience across the aerospace industry during many internships over the past 15 years.
