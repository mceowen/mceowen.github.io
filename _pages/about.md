I am currently a researcher and PhD candidate studying convex optimization based trajectory planning for aerospace vehicles in the Aeronautics and Astronautics department at the University of Washington. My research focus is primarily in sequential convex programming methods, specifically with the algorithm successive convexification, applied to aerial quadrotor drones and hypersonic reentry vehicles. I previously served as the manager for the physical lab space at the Autonomous Controls Lab for many years, before transitioning my focus to full-time reentry trajectory optimization research. During my academic studies I have also gained a wide variety of industry experience during internships in the aerospace sector over the past 15 years.
